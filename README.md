# AuroraPanel

A lightweight web hosting control panel for **Raspberry Pi** (and any Linux
box), laid out like cPanel: system monitoring, your own VPN server, websites,
databases, fail2ban, FTP, backups, Git and more — all from your browser.

Built with **FastAPI** (Python) + a dependency-free **vanilla JS** frontend, so
there's nothing to compile on the Pi.

**Version: v1.1.1** (`1.1.1`) — a free, open-source hobby project (MIT License). Website: https://aurora51.com

To update, open **Preferences → About & Updates → Check for updates** in the panel (it only contacts
aurora51.com when you click), or re-download the zip, unzip it over your install and re-run `sudo bash install.sh`.

Guides for the bigger features are in [`docs/`](docs/README.md).

**Feedback, bugs and ideas:** please share them in the
[Raspberry Pi Forums thread](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?p=2388892).

## Features

| Section | What it does |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **System** | Live dashboard (CPU, per-core load, temperature, throttling, memory, disks, uptime), `systemd` services grouped by state, processes, `apt` packages, `ufw` firewall (with lock-out protection), Linux users. **Updates** (security fixes marked, one-click install, automatic security or full updates with an optional restart time). **Alerts** by email, Telegram or webhook (Discord, Slack, ntfy) for disk, memory, temperature, power, stopped services, expiring certificates, attack bursts, failed logins, failed backups, waiting updates and restarts. **Servers**: every AuroraPanel you run on one page, with pinned certificates and ban-everywhere. **Panel Users** with roles: administrator, read-only viewer and website manager. |
| **Network** | VPN servers — **WireGuard** (QR codes), **OpenVPN** (per-user logins: certificate + password, password only or certificate only) and **IPsec/IKEv2** (native on iPhone/Mac/Windows) — each with an end-to-end self-test. Dynamic DNS (DuckDNS, No-IP, Dynu, deSEC, Cloudflare, FreeDNS, custom). Port Checker (outside probe, double-NAT/CGNAT detection, router instructions, UPnP). Network Monitor (who tried to connect). IP Blocker & Trust (ban IPs/ranges with expiry, trusted list). Fail2ban. Interfaces & Wi-Fi with confirm-or-revert. |
| **Databases** | MariaDB and PostgreSQL databases and users, wizards, phpMyAdmin link. |
| **Domains** | Apache virtual hosts (Force HTTPS, Let's Encrypt), folder sites at `http://<pi-ip>/<name>` (no domain needed), redirects, BIND zone editor, cPanel-style Dynamic DNS hosts (`home.example.com` follows a changing IP via a secret update URL or the DynDNS2 protocol most routers speak). |
| **Email** | A full mail server in one click (Postfix, Dovecot 2.4, Rspamd, Redis): email accounts with quotas and sign-in / receive / send restrictions, forwarders and domain forwarders (with a “where does this go?” trace), default address (catch-all), email routing (local / backup / remote MX), autoresponders (schedule, HTML, %subject%/%from% tags), mailing lists (members-only, announcements, DMARC-safe), per-account and global filters (Sieve), spam filters (thresholds, Junk folder, auto-delete, allow/block lists, greylisting), track delivery (every message, spam score, reason), deliverability checks with one-click DNS records (MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, PTR), DKIM signing, address importer (CSV), TLS (Let's Encrypt), mail queue, disk usage, webmail (Roundcube), calendars & contacts with sharing (CalDAV/CardDAV), and one-tap iPhone/Mac setup profiles. |
| **Security** | fail2ban jails (SSH, panel, OpenVPN, FTP, Apache, Nginx, MariaDB, port scans, repeat offenders), SSH keys, SSL/TLS, **AutoSSL** (Let's Encrypt for every site and the mail host, wildcards through the built-in DNS), **Site Isolation** (each site as its own user with its own PHP-FPM pool), **Activity Log** (who changed what, from where), an IP card for any address (owner, what it did here, ban / trust / report abuse), WAF Firewall (ModSecurity + OWASP Core Rule Set: blocking or detect-only, rule levels, app exclusions, trusted IPs, per-site off switch, recent attacks with one-click “allow this rule” and ban), hotlink protection, API tokens, TOTP two-factor login, panel HTTPS. |
| **Metrics** | Visitors (every request, searchable, sortable, column picker, bot filter, live mode, CSV export, ban an IP in one click), Errors from Apache, PHP, mail, database, DNS and the system — sorted into categories with repeats grouped and a hint for each, Bandwidth (HTTP, IMAP, POP3, SMTP, FTP and all interface traffic; 24 h / week / year, per site per month), Raw Access (download logs as-is or gzipped, retention), Analytics (AWStats-style: visitors, visits, pages, referrers, search engines, browsers, devices, 404s, robots — no tracking script) and Resource Usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, load, temperature, out-of-memory and under-voltage events, kept for a year). |
| **Files** | File manager (upload, edit, zip, recycle bin), Images (thumbnails, resize, WebP), Directory Privacy (password-protected folders), Disk & Inodes usage, Web Disk (WebDAV), FTP accounts (locked to a folder; full / read-only / upload-only), Backups (folders, single databases, upload & import `.sql` dumps, categories, live progress bars, several restores at once) + Backup Wizard (files and databases, selective restore), **Scheduled Backups** (hourly to monthly, AES-256 encrypted, to another disk, S3/R2/Wasabi, Backblaze B2, SFTP, WebDAV or any rclone remote, with retention), **Move from cPanel** (import a full cPanel backup: sites, databases and mailboxes keeping their passwords, mail, forwarders, DNS zones), Git Version Control (clone, pull, deploy, deploy keys). |
| **Advanced** | Browser terminal, cron wizard, `.htaccess` tools, ClamAV virus scanner, DNS tracing. |
| **Software** | One-click Apache / Nginx / Lighttpd / Caddy / PHP-FPM / MariaDB / vsftpd, each with a settings page, config editor (validated, auto-rollback) and logs; PHP settings and extensions; App Manager. |
| **App Installer** | Softaculous-style catalog of 40+ web apps in 18 categories (WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, phpBB, MediaWiki, Nextcloud, Moodle, OpenCart, Roundcube, Matomo, Laravel, Symfony…). Pick an app, choose Local / IP / domain / subdomain / existing site / any folder, and it downloads the latest release (checksum-verified where published), creates the database and — for apps with a command-line installer — sets up the admin account too, with a live progress bar. **WordPress Toolkit**: updates, hacked-file scan against wordpress.org checksums, hardening, auto-updates, maintenance mode and private staging copies. **Docker Apps**: Home Assistant, Jellyfin, Vaultwarden, Uptime Kuma, Pi-hole, Gitea, n8n and more, private by default behind an HTTPS web address. |

First launch walks you through creating the owner account (PBKDF2-hashed password, signed 8-hour
session cookies, optional TOTP 2FA). More people can be added as administrators, read-only viewers
or website managers who only see their own sites. The panel can be installed as an app from the
browser (with a trusted certificate). Most system actions require the panel to run as **root** (the systemd
unit does); features degrade gracefully where a tool (`ufw`, `systemctl`) is
absent.

## Quick start (development, Windows or Linux)

```bash
# Linux / macOS / Pi
./run.sh

# Windows
run.bat
```

Then open **http://localhost:8088** (dev) — on the first run you'll create your
admin username + password.

The scripts create a `.venv`, install `requirements.txt`, and start Uvicorn.

## Installing on a Raspberry Pi or an Ubuntu/Debian server

Works on any Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm or newer, and on any
Ubuntu or Debian server or VPS with systemd and Python 3.10+, under any user name.
A fresh server doesn't need anything else first: pages that need Apache, PHP,
MariaDB, an FTP server and so on offer to install them in one click, with a
progress bar.

```bash
git clone <your-repo> ~/AuroraPanel   # or copy the folder over
cd ~/AuroraPanel
sudo bash install.sh
```

The installer asks which port to use (default `8088`), installs the needed
packages, creates `.venv`, and sets up a `aurorapanel` systemd service that
starts on boot. It then prints the URLs to open, e.g. `https://<pi-ip>:8088`.

New installs use HTTPS with a self-signed certificate, so your login is never
sent in the clear. Your browser warns once ("Not private"): choose Advanced →
Proceed. Switch to a Let's Encrypt certificate or back to plain HTTP under
Security → Panel HTTPS, or install with `--no-https`.

| Command | What it does |
| ------- | ------------ |
| `sudo bash install.sh` | Interactive install (prompts for port) |
| `sudo bash install.sh --port 9000` | Non-interactive install on port 9000 |
| `sudo bash install.sh --no-https` | New install on plain HTTP instead of HTTPS |
| `sudo bash install.sh` (again) | Change the port / repair; keeps your admin account |
| `sudo bash install.sh --uninstall` | Remove AuroraPanel completely (asks first; add `--yes` to skip the question) |

If `ufw` is active, the chosen port is allowed automatically. The panel runs as
**root** so it can control services and read privileged files;
`deploy/aurorapanel.service` is a reference unit for manual installs.

## Configuration

Environment variables (set them before launch or in the systemd unit):

| Var | Default | Meaning |
| --- | ------- | ------- |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` (Linux) / `127.0.0.1` (Win) | Bind address |
| `PORT` | `8088` | Bind port |
| `AURORA_USER` | user who ran `install.sh` | The Pi's regular login (default home, protected from deletion) |
| `AURORA_FILE_ROOT` | not set (whole Pi; opens in the web root) | Confine the File Manager to this one folder |

Credentials are stored in `aurora_config.json` (git-ignored). Delete that file
to re-run first-time setup.

## Security notes

- **Turn on Panel HTTPS** (Security page) so your password and session cookie
  are encrypted on the network. It uses a self-signed certificate (or a Let's
  Encrypt one you already have) and switches back to HTTP by itself if the
  browser doesn't reach the new https:// address within 3 minutes.
- **Put it behind your LAN / VPN.** Reach it from outside through the built-in
  WireGuard/OpenVPN server rather than forwarding the panel port.
- Failed logins are throttled per IP (10 per 15 minutes) on top of fail2ban;
  changing the password or turning on 2FA signs out every other session.
- A strict Content-Security-Policy is sent with every page, and untrusted text
  (log lines, usernames from failed logins) is only ever rendered as text.
- The file manager opens in the web folder and can browse the whole Pi (like the root Terminal);
  set `AURORA_FILE_ROOT` to confine it to one folder (it then rejects `..`/symlink escapes). It
  refuses to delete `/`, top-level system folders, home folders and website folders. Service
  names are validated before being passed to `systemctl`.
- Sessions are HttpOnly, SameSite=strict cookies signed with a per-install
  secret that rotates whenever the password changes.
- Panel users get only what their role allows (deny by default), and every change is recorded in
  the Activity Log.

## Testing

Tests live in `tests/` (pytest, with a coverage report). They use a throwaway login, config and
File Manager folder, and only call read-only pages, so they never change your Pi.

| Where | Command | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| On a Pi (recommended) | `sudo bash tests/run.sh` | Everything, against the real system: every page loads without crashing, login and sessions, File Manager safety, Apache site rules |
| Any computer | `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && python -m pytest` | Same, minus the Linux-only parts (skipped on Windows/macOS) |
| GitHub | automatic on every push | Same suite on Ubuntu; the coverage report is attached to each run |

Open `htmlcov/index.html` afterwards to see which lines the tests reached. Run one area with
`-k`, e.g. `sudo bash tests/run.sh -k sites`.
